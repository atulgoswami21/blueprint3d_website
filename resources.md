Blueprint3D is built using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), a javascript 3D library. If you're new to three.js, [here](http://davidscottlyons.com/threejs/presentations/frontporch14/#slide-0) is a nice short introduction, info for [getting started](http://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene) and [documentation.](http://threejs.org/docs/) 

If you're entirely new to 3D graphics, [here](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs291/) is a nice Udacity course to help you get caught up to speed.
